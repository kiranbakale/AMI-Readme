On this page you'll find troubleshooting guidance for various areas when using the GitLab Environment Toolkit.

## Ansible Install Failure - `No matching distribution found`

Ansible `5.x` requires Python `3.8` and higher. Attempting to install this version of Ansible via `pip` on a lower version of Python will fail with the following error:

```sh
ERROR: No matching distribution found for ansible==5.0.1
```

Upgrade your Python version to `3.8` or higher and try installing again to fix.

## Python package install failure - `fatal error: 'openssl/opensslv.h' file not found`

For macOS users, installation of Python packages via `pip3 install` may fail with an error:

```plaintext
fatal error: 'openssl/opensslv.h' file not found
```

You may first need to set up compiler flags to point to OpenSSL:

```shell
brew install openssl@1.1 rust
export LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)/lib"
export CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)/include"
```

## Postgres Upgrade Error - `PostgreSQL did not respond before service checks were exhausted`

The following error can show when running the Toolkit on PostgreSQL nodes:

```sh
ruby_block[wait for postgresql to start] (patroni::enable line 105) had an error: RuntimeError: PostgreSQL did not respond before service checks were exhausted
```

This is due to a [rare application issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/5969) where the specific Secondary Postgres server has become corrupted and unable to sync replication with the Primary server, causing it to enter a restart loop.

If you examine the specific Postgres server's logs (`/var/log/gitlab/patroni/current`) you'll likely see the real error as follows:

```sh
LOG:  invalid resource manager ID in primary checkpoint record
PANIC:  could not locate a valid checkpoint record
/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql:5432 - rejecting connections
FATAL:  the database system is starting up
/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql:5432 - rejecting connections
FATAL:  the database system is starting up
LOG:  startup process (PID 3711) was terminated by signal 6: Aborted
LOG:  aborting startup due to startup process failure
```

To fix this you need to reset the WAL log on the specific server as follows:

```sh
sudo su - gitlab-psql -c '/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/pg_resetwal -f /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data'
```

:warning:&nbsp; This command deletes the current record and as such may lead to data loss. It should only be run on the specific server with the corrupted log.

This wipes the records from the specific server and will unblock it to start replicating again. This should **only** be run on the specific Secondary server that is failing and no others as this would lead to data loss.

## GCP Resource Creation Error - `Error 400: The resource '<subnetwork>' is not ready, resourceNotReady`

In select GCP setups you may see Terraform throw the following error on the first creation:

```sh
Error: Error creating instance: googleapi: Error 400: The resource 'projects/gitlab-qa-10k-cd77c7/regions/us-east1/subnetworks/default' is not ready, resourceNotReady
```

This looks to be a race condition issue on Google's end and is [currently being investigated by them](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/issues/10972).

This error only happens once and rerunning should succeed without issue.
