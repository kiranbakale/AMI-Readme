# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the GitLab Environment Toolkit! We welcome
all contributions. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the
[code of conduct](#code-of-conduct).

## Merge requests

We welcome merge requests with fixes and improvements to GitLab Environment Toolkit code and/or documentation. 
The issues that are specifically suitable for community contributions are listed with the label
[`Accepting Merge Requests` on our issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/gitlab-environment-toolkit/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Accepting+merge+requests), but you are
free to contribute to any other issue you want.

Please note that if an issue is marked for the current milestone either before
or while you are working on it, a team member may take over the merge request
in order to ensure the work is finished before the release date.

If you want to add a new feature that is not labeled it is best to first create
a feedback issue (if there isn't one already) and leave a comment asking for it
to be marked as `Accepting Merge Requests`.

Merge requests should be opened at [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/gitlab-environment-toolkit/-/merge_requests).

### Merge request guidelines

Please follow the [Merge Request Workflow](docs/development/merge_request_workflow.md) when working on a merge request.
